# Design

This repository contains .psd files for the Hoccer XO [Android](https://github.com/hoccer/hoccer-talk-spike) and [iOS](https://github.com/hoccer/hoccer-xo-iphone) clients. The .psd files donâ€™t represent the current status of the clients.

_**Info:** The .psd files also contain unplanned features and changes!_

## Key-screens

All .psd files of a client are collected in an .ai file. These .ai files are only maps of key-screens.

_**Info:** They don't provide any interaction or flow instructions!_
